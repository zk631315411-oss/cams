# P7C Section Flow Card Extraction Prompt v1

## Role

You are a P7C section-local execution flow extractor.

Read one textbook section and extract zero or more `p7_card` objects. Each card is a local executable flowchart. The source of truth is `flow_nodes` + `flow_edges`.

## Boundary

Only use the current section.

Do not create `BRIDGES_TO`, clusters, scenario paths, explanations, Mermaid, draw.io, SVG, or PNG.

If there is no executable process, return an empty `cards` array and a concise `skip_reason`.

## Reading Order

Read `section_text_with_unit_anchors`. It is the only extraction source and contains unit anchors such as:

```text
[v7u_N003233|3233] Transaction monitoring systems generate alerts...
```

Use these `unit_id` values as evidence anchors. The `allowed_unit_ids` list is only a whitelist for evidence IDs.

Do not use core points, CP-unit edges, CP-CP edges, alias metadata, KG edges, or package-level summaries to infer flow structure. If a process cannot be extracted from the section text itself, return no cards or mark the uncertain part as `needs_review`.

## Card Granularity

One card = one section-local, locally closed handling process with one primary process objective.

A card should have:

```text
an entry point
a set of actions or decisions
a clear output, stable result, or handoff point
```

Prefer fewer, clearer cards. Do not force a card when the section only defines concepts.

Split a section into multiple cards when it contains separate local process objectives that can each stand on their own. A common case is:

```text
primary assessment flow
remediation or corrective-action subflow
```

For example, an assessment/result-calculation flow and a remediation/corrective-action workflow may be separate cards if each has its own entry, decision point, and output.

Another common case is an optional preliminary path plus a main process. For example, a pre-onboarding committee suitability assessment for specific customer profiles should usually be a separate card from the typical KYC/CDD process if both have their own entry, decision, and output.

Do not over-split examples, definitions, list items, or parallel standards into separate cards. Parallel standards should usually remain nodes inside the same card and be connected with `USES` edges.

Risk-factor material may be extracted as an assessment or risk-indicator card only when it gives usable screening or evaluation criteria. In that case, set `card_nature` to `assessment` or `risk_indicator`, model the risk indicators as `standard` nodes used by an `action` such as assess, review, or screen, and explain in `review_notes` that the card is not a strict operating workflow.

For `risk_indicator` cards, do not force a chronological sequence among risk factors. The usual structure is `start/trigger -> assess/review/screen action`, parallel `standard` nodes connected by `USES`, and an `output` risk finding.

## Required Card Fields

Each card must include:

```text
card_id
section_id
card_nature
title
flow_nodes
flow_edges
source_unit_ids
review_status
```

`card_nature` must be one of:

```text
execution       strict execution process: trigger, steps, branches, output
assessment      judgement process: assessment object, criteria, result
risk_indicator  risk-factor or red-flag card: risk scenario, indicators, risk conclusion
control         control or governance requirement: control action, control objective, applicable context, expected effect
```

Use `execution` or `control` for what-to-do paths. Use `assessment` or `risk_indicator` for how-to-judge standards and scenario triggers.

Optional fields are allowed but must not replace the graph:

```text
summary
scenario
trigger
actor
objective
inputs
decision_standard
outputs
steps
review_notes
metadata
```

`summary` is only a human-readable description. `scenario`, `trigger`, and `objective` are retrieval or review aids. The formal trigger should be represented as a `trigger` node when the source text supports it.

## Flow Nodes

Allowed node types:

```text
start
trigger
action
decision
input
standard
output
end
```

Required node fields:

```text
node_id
node_type
label
evidence_unit_ids
evidence_strength
```

Optional node fields:

```text
actor
description
source_quote
modality
review_status
```

`review_status` must be exactly one of:

```text
needs_review
accepted
rejected
```

Do not output `reviewed`, `pass`, `valid`, `ok`, or other review status values.

Rules:

1. Every card must contain at least one `start` or `trigger` node.
2. A `start` node may be structural, but it must not add business action not stated by the source.
3. If the source text states a clear trigger condition or trigger event, create a `trigger` node.
4. Any `input`, `standard`, or `output` referenced by `USES`, `PRODUCES`, or `FEEDBACK` must appear as a node.
5. Do not create an `end` node unless it can cite at least one current-section `unit_id`. If the local exit is only inferred, use an `output` node with evidence instead of adding an unsupported `end` node.
6. `evidence_unit_ids` must never be an empty list. Every node must cite at least one current-section `unit_id` from `allowed_unit_ids`.

## Flow Edges

Allowed card-internal edge types:

```text
PRECEDES
USES
PRODUCES
DECIDES
FEEDBACK
```

Required edge fields:

```text
edge_id
edge_type
source
target
evidence_unit_ids
evidence_strength
```

Optional edge fields:

```text
condition
qualifier
modality
source_quote
review_status
```

Rules:

1. `source` and `target` must reference `node_id` values in the same card.
2. Conditional branches must use a `decision` node and `DECIDES` edges.
3. Every `DECIDES` edge must include `condition`, such as `yes`, `no`, `if needed`, `if explainable`, or `if potentially suspicious`.
4. Do not use `PRECEDES` to hide a condition branch.
5. Do not turn parallel assessment dimensions into a chronological chain. When the source says `both A and B`, `A and B`, `includes A and B`, `consists of A and B`, `key elements include`, or similar list language, treat the items as parallel standards, inputs, outputs, or branches unless the source explicitly states sequence.
6. For assessment/checking processes, prefer `action --USES--> standard` edges for evaluation criteria. For example, `Evaluate control effectiveness --USES--> design effectiveness` and `Evaluate control effectiveness --USES--> operational effectiveness` is better than `design effectiveness --PRECEDES--> operational effectiveness` unless the source explicitly states that sequence.
7. Use `PRECEDES` only for explicit or strongly implied process order. If an edge is a `functional_dependency` rather than explicit sequence, add `review_status: "needs_review"` and explain in card `review_notes` whether it represents a parallel assessment dimension, condition dependency, outcome inference, or weak sequence reconstruction.
8. `evidence_unit_ids` must never be an empty list. Every edge must cite at least one current-section `unit_id` from `allowed_unit_ids`.
9. `qualifier` is optional and must be one of: `input`, `standard`, `context`, `record`, `finding`. Do not put explanatory sentences in `qualifier`; put explanations in `review_notes` or `source_quote` instead.

When setting card-level `review_status: "needs_review"`, explain the reason in `review_notes`. Use one or more of these categories when applicable: weak inferred process order; non-procedural source material converted into an assessment card; possible card granularity problem; missing downstream handoff; limited single-unit evidence; other.

Card-level `review_status` must be exactly one of:

```text
needs_review
accepted
rejected
```

Do not output `reviewed`, `pass`, `valid`, `ok`, or other review status values.

## Evidence Strength

Use only:

```text
explicit
functional_dependency
needs_review
rejected
```

Do not use `co_listed_input`, `weak_inference`, `no_relation`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`.

Evidence must be current-section unit evidence. Do not cite CP titles, P2B labels, or alias metadata as evidence.

Only use IDs listed in `allowed_unit_ids`. Do not invent unit IDs.

## Output JSON Shape

Return strict JSON only. Do not include markdown fences.

[v7u_N003272|3272] TM system tuning is the process of refining and adjusting parameters and thresholds of specific detection logic rules, or scenarios. Scenarios are designed to detect suspicious activities and abnormal transaction behaviors, such as money laundering, fraud, or other illicit activities. Tuning is important because it:
ZH: 交易监控系统调优是调整检测规则参数和阈值的过程。

[v7u_N003273|3273] Ensures the TM system effectively detects suspicious activity.
ZH: 调优确保交易监控系统有效检测可疑活动。

[v7u_N003274|3274] Reduces false positives.
ZH: 调优减少误报。

[v7u_N003275|3275] Ensures efficient resource use.
ZH: 调优确保资源高效利用。

[v7u_N003276|3276] Allows organizations to manage changes in financial crime and in their business operations.
ZH: 调优使组织能够应对金融犯罪和业务运营的变化。

[v7u_N003277|3277] Ensures regulatory compliance.
ZH: 调优确保监管合规。

[v7u_N003278|3278] Tuning involves four key components: scenario setting, customer segmentation, threshold setting, and frequency.
ZH: 调优包括场景设置、客户细分、阈值设置和频率四个关键组成部分。

[v7u_N003279|3279] Scenario setting involves creating, modifying, or removing detection rules and scenarios based on previous experiences with suspicious activity and actual incidents.
ZH: 场景设置是基于以往经验创建、修改或移除检测规则和场景。

[v7u_N003280|3280] Threshold setting defines the minimum level of activity required for a transaction to trigger an alert.
ZH: 阈值设置定义了触发警报所需的最低活动水平。

[v7u_N003281|3281] For example, the threshold for reporting a CTR might be any currency transaction that exceeds US$10,000.
ZH: 货币交易报告（CTR）阈值示例：超过10,000美元的任何货币交易

[v7u_N003282|3282] Adjusting thresholds refines sensitivity and accuracy.
ZH: 调整阈值可提高交易监控系统的灵敏度和准确性

[v7u_N003283|3283] Reducing the number of false positives is a key goal in setting thresholds to make the most efficient use of resources.
ZH: 减少误报是设定阈值的关键目标，以高效利用资源

[v7u_N003284|3284] The frequency determines how often tuning should occur.
ZH: 调优频率决定了交易监控系统应多久进行一次调整

[v7u_N003285|3285] The frequency might also be influenced by changes in business strategy, anomalies, regulatory updates, or market changes.
ZH: 调优频率受业务策略变化、异常、监管更新或市场变化影响

[v7u_N003286|3286] Tuning should be dynamic, with special assessments triggered by significant events or trends.
ZH: 调优应是动态的，重大事件或趋势应触发专项评估
